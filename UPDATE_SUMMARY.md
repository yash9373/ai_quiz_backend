# Backend Update Summary - User Table Schema Changes

## Overview
The backend has been successfully updated to match the new database schema requirements. Here's a comprehensive summary of all changes made:

## Database Schema Changes

### Old Schema (users table):
```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  email VARCHAR UNIQUE,
  role ENUM('candidate', 'recruiter') DEFAULT 'candidate',
  hashed_password VARCHAR,
  name VARCHAR
);
```

### New Schema (user table):
```sql
CREATE TABLE user (
  user_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
  email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  role ENUM('candidate', 'recruiter') NOT NULL,
  hashed_password VARCHAR NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT now(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT now()
);
```

## Files Modified

### 1. User Model (`app/models/user.py`)
- Changed table name from `users` to `user`
- Changed primary key from `id` to `user_id`
- Added field constraints (NOT NULL, VARCHAR length limits)
- Added `created_at` and `updated_at` timestamp fields
- Made role field required (no default value)

### 2. User Schema (`app/schemas/user_schema.py`)
- Updated `UserRegister` to include required `role` field
- Added `UserResponse` schema with proper field mapping
- Updated field references to use `user_id` instead of `id`

### 3. Auth Service (`app/services/Auth/auth_service.py`)
- Updated user creation to use `user_id` instead of `id`
- Made role field required in registration (no default)
- Added proper role validation with error handling
- Updated field order to match new schema requirements

### 4. Auth Controller (`app/controllers/auth_controller.py`)
- Updated `/me` endpoint to return `user_id` instead of `id`
- Maintained all existing role-based access control functionality

### 5. Database Migration
- Created proper Alembic migration setup
- Added migration to transform `users` table to `user` table
- Handled PostgreSQL enum type conflicts
- Used proper CASCADE operations for clean schema updates

## Key Features Maintained

### 1. Authentication System
- JWT token-based authentication
- Secure password hashing with bcrypt
- Token blacklisting for logout functionality

### 2. Role-Based Access Control
- Candidate and Recruiter roles
- Protected endpoints with role verification
- Proper HTTP 403 responses for unauthorized access

### 3. Database Operations
- Async PostgreSQL operations
- Connection pooling
- Proper transaction handling

## API Endpoints (No Changes to External Interface)

### Authentication Endpoints
- `POST /auth/register` - User registration (now requires role)
- `POST /auth/login` - User login
- `POST /auth/logout` - User logout
- `GET /auth/me` - Get current user info

### Role-Based Endpoints
- `GET /auth/candidate-only` - Candidate-only access
- `GET /auth/recruiter-only` - Recruiter-only access

## Testing Results

All endpoints have been tested and are working correctly:

### Registration Tests
✅ Candidate registration with required role
✅ Recruiter registration with required role
✅ Proper validation of required fields

### Authentication Tests
✅ User login with correct credentials
✅ JWT token generation and validation
✅ Protected endpoint access with valid tokens

### Role-Based Access Tests
✅ Candidate-only endpoint allows candidates
✅ Candidate-only endpoint blocks recruiters (403)
✅ Recruiter-only endpoint allows recruiters
✅ Recruiter-only endpoint blocks candidates (403)

## Database Migration Process

1. **Backup**: Original schema preserved in migration downgrade
2. **Clean Drop**: Removed old tables and types with CASCADE
3. **Schema Creation**: Applied new schema with proper constraints
4. **Verification**: Tested all operations against new schema

## Breaking Changes

### For API Consumers
- Registration now **requires** the `role` field
- User ID field in responses changed from `id` to `user_id`
- Role field is now mandatory (no default value)

### For Database
- Table name changed from `users` to `user`
- Primary key field renamed from `id` to `user_id`
- Added timestamp fields (`created_at`, `updated_at`)
- Stricter field constraints (NOT NULL, length limits)

## Configuration Files Updated

- `create_tables.py` - Updated for new schema
- Alembic migration files created
- Database connection handling for reserved keywords

## Error Handling

Enhanced error handling for:
- Missing role field in registration
- Invalid role values
- Database constraint violations
- Authentication token validation

## Performance Considerations

- Maintained indexed fields (email, user_id)
- Preserved async database operations
- Kept connection pooling configuration
- No impact on query performance

## Security Features Maintained

- Password hashing with bcrypt
- JWT token security
- SQL injection protection
- Role-based authorization
- Token blacklisting for logout

The backend is now fully compliant with the new database schema while maintaining all existing functionality and security features.
